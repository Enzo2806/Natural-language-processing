To maximize his profit, Bew would chemically alter the cocaine either by “cooking” it into crack, or by <WSD>“rerocking”</WSD> it – a process through which he diluted the cocaine with substances such as paint thinner. Bew sold the crack directly to users and the <WSD>rerock</WSD> cocaine to drug dealers./ […] Fuller argues that no reasonable jury could infer that he shared a stake in a larger drug trafficking conspiracy because Bew regularly duped him by selling him <WSD>rerocked</WSD> cocaine.  But the only evidence that this scam had any effect on Fuller's sales is the recording of one phone call in which Fuller complained about a “drought” caused by “bad drugs.” There is no evidence that Fuller had trouble profiting from the <WSD>rerocked</WSD> cocaine on a regular basis.  And the fact that Bew dishonestly tried to maximize his own profits by secretly diluting the cocaine used in his transactions with Fuller does not diminish the evidence showing that Bew relied on Fuller to sell the <WSD>rerocked</WSD> cocaine.  Accordingly, Fuller has not met his heavy burden of showing that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conspiracy conviction.	rerock.verb.1

When, instead either of a certain portion of the produce of land, or of the price of a certain portion, a certain sum of money is to be paid in full compensation for all tax or tythe; the tax becomes, in this case, exactly of the same nature with the land tax of England. It neither rises nor falls with the rent of the land. It neither encourages nor discourages improvement. The tythe in the greater part of those parishes which pay what is called a <WSD>modus</WSD>, in lieu of all other tythe is a tax of this kind. During the Mahometan government of Bengal, instead of the payment in kind of the fifth part of the produce, a <WSD>modus</WSD>, and, it is said, a very moderate one, was established in the greater part of the districts or zemindaries of the country. Some of the servants of the East India company, under pretence of restoring the public revenue to its proper value, have, in some provinces, exchanged this <WSD>modus</WSD> for a payment in kind. Under their management, this change is likely both to discourage cultivation, and to give new opportunities for abuse in the collection of the public revenue, which has fallen very much below what it was said to have been when it first fell under the management of the company. The servants of the company may, perhaps, have profited by the change, but at the expense, it is probable, both of their masters and of the country.	modus.noun.2
