# Assignment 1: Animal Facts Classification Project

## Goal of the Assignment
This project investigated the classification of animal facts into real or fake categories using linear classifiers and various preprocessing techniques. We explored three different classifiers—SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes—and three preprocessing techniques: lemmatization, stemming, and stop-word removal. The dataset comprised 100 real and 100 fake facts about three different animals, generated using ChatGPT 3.5. Our experiments aimed to determine the most effective classifier and preprocessing combination, using a dataset split into training, validation, and testing sets. The results indicated that linear classifiers are effective in distinguishing between real and fake animal facts, with SVM consistently performing the best across various setups.

## Running the Project
To run this project, you will need to install the required Python packages. Use the following command to install the dependencies from the requirements file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusion

The study concluded that while all tested classifiers and preprocessing techniques performed similarly, SVM showed the highest accuracy. This project underscores the capabilities and limitations of using linear classifiers for text classification tasks in a controlled experimental setup.
